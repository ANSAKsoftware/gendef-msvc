When Packaged, ANSAK Software components install themselves, by default into:
C:\ProgramData

These are further partitioned into
1. C:\ProgramData\bin -- where .exe and .dll components go
2. C:\ProgramData\lib -- where library components go
3. C:\ProgramData\include -- where headers go

In the absence of a good standard /usr/include, /usr/lib and derivatives paths
on Windows, these seem to be the most reasonable places to use, and for
instance followed Chocolaty's lead for binaries at least.

For libraries ANSAK components build for 32-bit and 64-bit versions, for the
standard CMake configurations: Release, Debug, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel.

Libraries (.LIB) are partitioned within C:\ProgramData\lib, by default,
according to:
    <arch>\<config>\<lib-name>.lib

Dynamic-linked Libraries (.DLL), when they are produced, are partitioned,
within C:\ProgramData\bin, by default, by name:
    <lib-name>-<arch>.dll
